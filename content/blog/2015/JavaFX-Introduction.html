<p><b>JavaFX</b> is a software platform for creating Rich Internet Applications that can run across variety of platforms[1].It
has a collection of Java Packages with ability to add fancy GUI to your Java application. 
JavaFX is official standard part of Java platform. JavaFX is considered as a successor of Swing
and can be easily understood by a Swing developer. You can get the latest in JavaFX in early access preview 
of JavaFX in <a href="https://jdk8.java.net/download.html">Java 8 EA 40</a></p>
<p><b>History:</b> Formerly it was called in F3(Form Follows function) and developed by Oliver Smith at Sun 
    Microsystems. JavaFX was initially developed as a scripting language however it was later 
    discontinued by Oracle and declared dead in Java One 2010. Now JavaFX has a clean Java API. 

<p>
    <b>JavaFX Lingo</b>
In order to understand JavaFX well one needs to familiarize with the Jargon used
<ul>
    <li>Stage - Top level container for all Java Objects</li>
    <li>Scene - A scene is a hierarchical node structure that contains all scenes components</li>
    <li>Group - Group is a general purpose container node</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Stage:</b> Stage is implicitly created by JavaFX. JavaFX makes you think like a designer and 
stage is where you will host your scene</p>
<p><b>Scene:</b>A scene is a hierarchical node structures that contains all sceneâ€™s components</p>
<p><b>Group:</b>Group is general purpose container node. This is analogous to a layout creates</p>

<p><b>Various possibilities with JavaFX</b></p>
<ul>
<li>CSS Support</li>
<li>Visual Effects: Shadow,reflect,blur perspective</li>
<li>Animation- rotate,scale,translate etc</li>
<li>Chars</li>
<li>3D Object - cubes,cylinder,spheres etc</li>
<li>Touch Interface</li>
<li>Property bindings</li>
</ul>

<b>JavaFX Application Life Cycle</b>
<ol>
    <li>init (): Default implementation of init does nothing. 
        One can override to perform any processing before application UI is displayed</li>
<li>start (): No default implementation and is declared abstract. 
    Your app must override this. Build and display the UI</li>
<li>Wait for application to End. Typically happens when user signals end of program</li>
<li>stop(): Default implementation does not do anything
    One can override to to perform any necessary processing as program terminates</li> 
<ul>

        Button btn = new Button();
        btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");
        btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
            
            @Override
            public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
                System.out.println("Hello World!");
            }
        });
        
        StackPane root = new StackPane();
        root.getChildren().add(btn);
        
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250);
        
        primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World!");
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    /**
     * @param args the command line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
    
}

    <P><b>Code Walk through</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Any JavaFX application must extend javafx.application.Application</li>
    <li>The start method is overriden. The override also passes the Stage object</li>   
    <li>Button object is instantiated and event handler is associated</li>
    <li>A stack pane is created. This is a layout and corresponds to the group</li>
    <li>Create the Scene object and pass the group reference </li>
    <li>The scene is hosted on the stage</li>
    <li>In main (the main entry point for java application) launch is called. This launches
        the JavaFX application.</li></ul>
