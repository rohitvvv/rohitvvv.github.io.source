&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello. This is Rohit Vaidya. I am passionate about Computer Science and hold a masters degree in the field. Simply put, I love solving problems. Problems that if solved, will add value to someone life. I idolize Sir Donald Knuth for his 30 years of work on Art of Computer Programming. There are numerous things I don’t understand in that book and I know I am not alone. But what ever I do understand, just gives you the feeling of cognitive ecstacy. I like to be lost. Lost in these volumes of books/problems/love. As Jason Silva(Futurist) puts it “We need to be lost to find ourselves”. Late astronaut Kalpana Chawla once said “The journey is more important than the destination”  I am on my journey and I am loving it.

	&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;In my spare time I love doing Mathematics and put my skills in Computer Algorithms to test. My hobbies includes reading,  playing chess and analysing games(EXPTIME Complete, computationally non solvable game),  doing math and playing the acoustic Guitar..
